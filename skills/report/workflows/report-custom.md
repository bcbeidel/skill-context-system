</required_reading>

<process>

## Step 1: Determine Custom Parameters

Parse `$ARGUMENTS` or ask user for:

**Date range:**
- Start date
- End date

**OR comparison points:**
- Baseline date/snapshot
- Current date/snapshot

**OR milestone:**
- Project phase
- Release version
- Specific event

## Step 2: Execute Custom Report Script

Run with custom parameters:

```bash
python ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/report/scripts/generate_report.py --custom --from=[start] --to=[end]
```

Or for comparisons:

```bash
python ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/report/scripts/generate_report.py --custom --compare=[baseline]
```

## Step 3: Generate Custom Dashboard

Adapt dashboard format based on requested comparison:

### For Date Range Reports

```markdown
# 📊 Custom Context Report

**Period:** [Start] to [End]
**Duration:** [N] days
**Generated:** [Timestamp]

---

## 📈 Period Summary

[Metrics for the specified period]

### Key Changes

| Metric | Start | End | Change |
|--------|-------|-----|--------|
| Files | [n] | [n] | [+/-] |
| Tokens | [n] | [n] | [+/-%] |
| Large Files | [n] | [n] | [+/-] |

### Activity During Period

[List of significant changes/optimizations]

### Analysis

[Context-specific insights for this period]
```

### For Milestone Reports

```markdown
# 📊 Context Report: [Milestone Name]

**Milestone:** [Name]
**Date:** [Date]
**Comparison Baseline:** [Prior milestone or date]

---

## 🎯 Milestone Context

[What this milestone represents]

## 📈 Changes Since Last Milestone

[Comparative metrics]

## 💡 Insights

[Milestone-specific analysis]
```

### For Comparison Reports

```markdown
# 📊 Context Comparison Report

**Baseline:** [Description and date]
**Current:** [Description and date]
**Time Between:** [Duration]

---

## 📊 Side-by-Side Comparison

[Detailed comparison table]

## 📈 Evolution

[How context evolved between points]

## 💡 Key Takeaways

[Insights from comparison]
```

## Step 4: Save and Return

- Save to `.claude/analytics/custom-report-[date].md`
- Provide path to user
- Suggest next steps based on findings

</process>

<success_criteria>
Custom report is complete when:
- ✅ Custom parameters correctly interpreted
- ✅ Appropriate data loaded for range/comparison
- ✅ Dashboard format suits the request
- ✅ Insights are relevant to the specific comparison
- ✅ Report saved with descriptive filename
- ✅ User understands the analysis
</success_criteria>

<example_output>

```markdown
# 📊 Custom Context Report

**Period:** Pre-Optimization to Post-Optimization
**Baseline:** Feb 1, 2026
**Current:** Feb 10, 2026
**Duration:** 9 days

---

## 🎯 Report Purpose

Comparing context state before and after major optimization effort.

---

## 📈 Before & After

| Metric | Before (Feb 1) | After (Feb 10) | Change | Impact |
|--------|----------------|----------------|--------|--------|
| Total Tokens | 125,340 | 92,100 | -33,240 | -26.5% ✅ |
| Files | 47 | 45 | -2 | Consolidated |
| Large Files | 2 | 0 | -2 | ✅ Eliminated |
| Avg Tokens/File | 2,667 | 2,047 | -620 | -23% ✅ |
| Token Budget | 63% | 46% | -17% | ✅ Improved |

---

## 💡 Optimization Impact

### Actions Taken
1. Split IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md (973 → 187 lines)
2. Split .seed-prompt.md (650 → 145 lines)
3. Archived backup files

### Results
- **33,240 tokens saved** (26.5% reduction)
- **All large files eliminated**
- **Improved scanability** of main files
- **Better organization** with references/ structure

### Time Investment
- Analysis: ~10 minutes
- Splitting: ~20 minutes
- **Total: ~30 minutes**

### ROI
- 1,108 tokens saved per minute
- Significant quality improvement
- Better navigation and maintenance

---

## 🎯 Conclusion

The optimization effort was highly successful:
✅ Exceeded 20% token reduction goal (achieved 26.5%)
✅ Eliminated all large files
✅ Maintained all information
✅ Improved structure and organization

**Recommendation:** Maintain this quality through regular monitoring.
